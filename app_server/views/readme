Express is a web application framework
Based on node.js

myspace, ghost are built on Express

Foundation for other tools like Kraken, Sails

npm = node packet manager

app.get('/', function(request, response))

other functions app.post, app.put,app.patch..

app.get will be called at each request / function(request, response) is a callback function

in fact, request is of type http.IncomingMessage which is a node.js object
response is of type http.ServerResponse which is a node.js object

you can therefore call node function from Express

for example
    express api : response.send
    node api : response.write + response.send

Express is top 5 node module 

uses MVC concept = model + view + controller

Middleware = get the HTTP request
Routing = routes the request
Template engine = EJS, Handlebars, Jade

MVC

    A request comes into the application.
    The request gets routed to a controller.
    The controller, if necessary, makes a request to the model.
    The model responds to the controller.
    The controller sends a response to a view.
    The view sends a response to the original requester.
